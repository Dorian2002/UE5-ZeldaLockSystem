## Project presentation :

I developed this system in Blueprint with Unreal Engine 5.1. This project has been made for homework in my third year of graduate school.
The goal was to reproduce the enemy locking system of Zelda. Find the instructions (in french) in the pdf file.
You can find all the uassets I used except the map in the project.
